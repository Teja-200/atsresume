            "3.  **Impressive Projects:**\n",
            "    *   **Diversity:** You showcase both full-stack development (Mentor-Connect, Mobile Location Bot) and strong UI/UX design skills (Zomato UI Clone). This broadens your appeal significantly.\n",

            "1.  **Clarify CGPA Asterisk:** The `8.89*` for your CGPA is a bit ambiguous. What does the asterisk signify? Is it out of 10, or a current GPA, or something else? Clarify it (e.g., \"8.89/10\" or \"8.89 (current)\").\n",
            "2.  **Explicit LinkedIn URL:** While `ð Teja -Dwarampudi` is likely your LinkedIn, it's best practice to include the direct URL (e.g., `linkedin.com/in/tejadwarampudi`). This removes any guesswork and makes it clickable.\n",
            "3.  **Quantify More (If Possible):** While your project descriptions are good, if there's *any* way to add quantifiable impact (e.g., \"facilitated X mentorship sessions,\" \"designed for Y unique users,\" \"reduced Z error rate by P%\"), it would make them even stronger. This is often harder for personal student projects, so don't force it if it doesn't fit naturally.\n",
            "4.  **Optional: \"Achievements\" or \"Awards\" Section:** If you have any significant academic awards, hackathon wins, or leadership roles, a small section could add another layer of distinction. Given your excellent academic results, this could be a place to briefly highlight any related scholarships or honors.\n",

If not, pursuing relevant certifications could further strengthen the profile and fill the only identified gap.\n",
            "2.  **Quantify Achievements (Where Possible):** While project descriptions are good, consider adding metrics to demonstrate impact. For example, for Mentor-Connect, if applicable, \"supported X number of users,\" or \"reduced mentor-finding time by Y%.\" For Zomato UI Clone, \"designed X number of screens\" or \"focused on improving Y user flow.\"\n",
            "3.  **Include a Portfolio/GitHub Link:** Given the strong project work, a link to a personal portfolio website or a well-organized GitHub profile where these projects can be explored would significantly enhance the resume.\n",
            "4.  **Briefly Mention Career Goals/Interests:** Adding a line or two about specific areas of interest within full-stack development (e.g., particular frameworks, cloud technologies, AI integration) could demonstrate forward-thinking and continuous learning aspirations.\n",
            "5.  **Consider a \"Soft Skills\" Section (Optional):** While implied through projects, explicitly listing soft skills such as teamwork, communication, adaptability, or leadership could be beneficial for roles that emphasize these qualities.\n"
